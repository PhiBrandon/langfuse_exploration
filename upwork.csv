Help to create OCR systems to extract tables from images - Upwork,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Help-create-OCR-systems-extract-tables-from-images_%7E01bbf946f1ca28b949?source=rss,6/6/2024 4:55am,"We are looking for an expert to assist us in setting up a system to extract tables (to a csv) from images. The images are taken from screenshots of a table on a SD monitor and there will always be exactly the same table columns and headers, though the rows and cells containing data will be constantly different, including some empty cells.

There are also multiple variations of formatted colours, though our tests have shown this isn't an issue.

We have tried mainstream OCR including visual inspection using Chat GPT 4o and they are not accurate enough for our requirements. We have also tried tesseract, though this is not accurate at all out of the box and we don't think we'd need to train a model for a task this simple.

We have trialed AWS Textract and the results were accurate from the draft, though we'd need to set up something simple to automate this process and ensure we were always getting the correct columns extracted. We would also need to ensure the data is clean. We'd also be interested in finding a way to differentiate the extracted data if say, a cell had grey text rather than black text, as this varies in different tables.

In your response, tell us which approach you would use and how many hours you would expect this to take. 

I am happy to consider a fixed rate for this job as well once we have agreed to the specific requirements.

Here is a screenshot of the error I am getting:

- you share a high level how you would extract the data into a csv

- please share how long this would take you

- add the word blue in all caps as the first word of your outreach

- if possible, how much this would cost

1. Get Calls Logs for All Users in my account

2. Get Voicemails for All Users in my account

3. Add Contact to my account

4. Update Contact in my account

5. Add User to my account (and assign phone number)

The functions should be similar to the below examples:

#########

def get_access_token(client_id, client_secret):

    url = ""https://zoom.us/oauth/token""

    auth = (client_id, client_secret)

    data = 'grant_type': 'client_credentials'

I have already tried running these codes myself but I get a 403 error which likely means I haven't enabled the backend app correctly in the Zoom Settings, so you will need to have the ability to log in to my account (I will give you credentials) and ensure everything is setup correctly there.

The Instagram account belonging to our sports club got hacked.

Now it's sending messages to all our followers and trying to hack them too.

Instagram's help center is useless, it just all goes in a loop.

Is there a way to get that back?

The only obstacle I found, was that when  I finally get to the 2-point authenticator option, I don't have it.

Presumeably the hacker has it, but I also have the same problem with my Facebook account.

I wonder if it's set up on an old phone or something, I have no idea.

Developer Needed for CSV to JSON Transformation and High-Volume Data Serving (2) - Upwork,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Developer-Needed-for-CSV-JSON-Transformation-and-High-Volume-Data-Serving_%7E012166cb49f8196c3d?source=rss,6/6/2024 2:01am,"We are seeking an experienced developer to help us create a serverless application within our AWS environment. The goal of this project is to periodically retrieve a CSV file from a URL, store it in S3, transform its content into a JSON feed, and efficiently serve individual objects from this feed via a query string. The response should be cached to handle high-volume traffic.

Project Requirements:

1. Retrieve CSV File:

   - Every 60 minutes download a CSV file from a specified URL.

   - Store the downloaded CSV file in an S3 bucket.

2. Transform CSV to JSON:

   - Parse the CSV content and transform it into a JSON format.

   - Each row in the CSV should be converted to a JSON object with an added unique identifier (`id`).

3. Serve JSON Data:

   - Create a function to retrieve a specific object from the JSON array based on a query string parameter (e.g., `?id=3`).

   - If no matching object is found, the function should return a random object from the array.

4. Cache Responses:

   - Implement caching for the responses to ensure the solution can handle high-volume HTTP traffic.

   - The cache should be invalidated and updated whenever the CSV file is re-downloaded and processed.

Technical Requirements:

- The solution should be built using AWS services, ideally leveraging serverless technologies such as AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and S3.

- The application should be designed for scalability and efficiency, ensuring minimal latency for data retrieval.

- Proper error handling and logging should be implemented for monitoring and troubleshooting purposes.

Deliverables:

- A fully functional serverless application deployed in our AWS environment.

- Source code with clear documentation.

- Configuration and deployment instructions.

- A brief test plan to verify the functionality of the application.

Skills Required:

- Proficiency in AWS services (Lambda, S3, API Gateway, etc.)

- Experience with serverless application development

- Strong understanding of JSON and CSV data formats

- Expertise in caching strategies for high-volume traffic

If you have experience in building scalable, serverless applications and can meet the above requirements, we would love to hear from you.

It has a couple of minor bugs that needs fixing… But I didn’t want to put more into it because some of the software that I used and some of the plug-ins with WordPress are out of date.

Ultimately, I wanted to rewrite in some more native. But I’ve been waiting to try to figure out how to do that efficiently and economically.

Well, lo and behold, I recently learned from a couple of tech guys that switching my site from WP to some other code isn’t as hard as it once was due to AI and chat GPT and AI agents and the like… Being able to convert code for you and create code and solve problems.

I know that if I put my mind to it, I could probably do it, but I don’t feel comfortable, trying to take such a task.

Nevertheless, I would like to find out if this is something that you could do.

Just take WordPress and convert it into something like Python and Django And may be hosted on wagtail or something.

The site doesn’t need to be perfectly identical by any means, and a lot of the bells and whistles can be dismissed or taken out, but the main functionalities of the site, obviously need to be there and working.","Python,     WordPress,     Web Development,     Django    ",CMS Development,United Kingdom,,$10.00,$15.00,https://www.upwork.com/ab/feed/jobs/rss?paging=NaN-undefined&payment_verified=1&q=(%22AI%20Engineer%22%20OR%20%22Data%20Engineer%22%20OR%20%22Cloud%20Engineer%22%20OR%20%22AWS%22%20OR%20%22Amazon%20Web%20Services%22%20OR%20%22Python%22%20OR%20%22Terraform%22%20OR%20%22DevOps%22%20OR%20%22SQL%22%20OR%20%22AWS%22%20OR%20%22Prompt%20Engineering%22)%20AND%20NOT%20(%22Google%20Cloud%22%20OR%20%22React%22%20OR%20%22Angular%22%20OR%20%22Tableau%22%20OR%20%22Ruby%22%20OR%20%22Laravel%22)&sort=recency&api_params=1&securityToken=75380e3d9358ff90936854a38a1b702b2f5e24519685701c6e412b66a48dccbca92f92dfdd61072831e978487b0af1f98ec0399c1771e068b429b47f60bb1d53&userUid=1771518215878287360&orgUid=1771518215878287361,,,,,

You will need to have had experience performing remote access technical support to end-users to be considered for this role.

Before you apply please read through all of the sections below carefully.

A. Shift Setup (Part Time)

The shifts operate 7 days a week and you are required to be available for ALL 7 days. Weekends are on-call, meaning you don't need to be at a desk to do your work but you must be available in the designated shift block to answer calls and deal with high-priority tickets and respond to alerts.

You must demonstrate that you have completed 4 hours work on every shift during the week. You must be available to take calls and answer tickets across the whole 8 hours shift block. 

All our systems come with mobile apps so doing this whilst you're on the go (but still in a quiet area when taking a call) should be ok. The arrangements above mean you could have a second contract running at the same time but it's recommended that the other contract isn't one that requires you to take calls.

"I have a short python script that works, but I need help optimizing it / refactoring it. - Upwork",https://www.upwork.com/jobs/have-short-python-script-that-works-but-need-help-optimizing-refactoring_%7E01fd59f9b007d26ec8?source=rss,6/5/2024 9:30pm,"I have a short python script that works, but I need an expert to look at it and optimize it.

The script takes a question and a csv file and uses a gpt model to write a python script that is capable of finding all of the relevant records in the csv file requested by the question.

Example: ""get me all photos taken in 2024"".

The gpt model writes python that goes through the CSV and returns all of the IDs for any row the has a created date of 2024 in the CreationDate field.

There is a second GPT model, and we want it to stay separate, that summarizes what they python is doing.

There is a little function that counts the number of IDs found.

All of this should be packaged to return an output that looks like the image attached.

Ok the script I have attached is just a simple python script, but I need to modify it so that it can get its question and csv file from an API POST call.

Please see the second script to see how that was set up originally. We need to basically take this next python script and refactor it so that it can be used on our server at that endpoint.

Note that the script on the server take in 4 variables from the POST CALL that help the script know when a new conversation is starting as well as a unique conversation ID.

Love to chat. Thinking an expert could knock this out for a fixed price in an hour or two.

Thanks

In the code, I assume that you will need to get bars as a 1D array of marks, but I have not made that conversion yet. The Python code uses data from ThetaData (https://thetadata.stoplight.io/docs/thetadata-rest-api/4ffe7dae9cc5f-quotes), but that has strings mixed in with reals, so that's why I think the 1D array of marks will be appropriate.

1. Identifying qualified swing highs and lows.

2. Tracking qualified ranges.

3. Tracking the 50% level of the qualified ranges.

4. Entering trades based on the criteria.

Step-by-Step Implementation

1. Identify Qualified Swing Highs and Lows

Qualified Swing Highs:

* Detect consecutive bullish candles followed by a bearish candle.

* Track the highest wick between the last bullish candle and the bearish candle (expansion line).

* Track the wick of the bearish candle (correction line).

* Confirm a swing high if another bearish candle closes below the correction line before any candle closes above the expansion line.

Qualified Swing Lows:

* Detect consecutive bearish candles followed by a bullish candle.

* Track the lowest wick between the last bearish candle and the bullish candle (expansion line).

* Track the wick of the bullish candle (correction line).

* Confirm a swing low if another bullish candle closes above the correction line before any candle closes below the expansion line.

2. Track Qualified Ranges

* Identify ranges expanding between 8:00 - 8:45 AM EST and 9:10 - 9:45 AM EST.

* Ensure the range created is at least 60 points or more.

3. Track the 50% Level of the Qualified Range

* Calculate the midpoint of the identified ranges.

4. Enter Trades

* Enter a trade when the price comes back to the 50% level and creates a balanced price range imbalance.

BO means the bayesian optimization

so, i use the encoder which has attention layer and deepsets layer combined. 

So, data for BO would be fed into encoder, and given to RL (PPO) and RL would make actions based on his policy.

and when the action is made, GP(Gaussian process model) will act as an environment, give the next state and reward.

and i want both encoder and RL agent will be trained with this reward.

Your company, a café business with customer base in Southeast Asia, is experiencing significant growth in online orders. The current on-premises infrastructure is struggling to keep up with the increasing demand, leading to slow loading times and frequent outages during peak seasons.

Your Task:

As a Cloud Solution Architect, you are tasked with designing a scalable and secure cloud solution on AWS to support the company's cafe platform.

Task 1: Designing and deployment of AWS Cloud

As a cloud solution architect, hired by AWS, you need to help your client in migrating their on-premises business to AWS cloud. The client has complaint that the capital expenditure for their current business is too high especially on the server maintenance, software licensing and unpredictable number of users, etc. Therefore, they are considering migrating their business operation to cloud. The cloud they are choosing is AWS Cloud. They have a few existing assets such as website, database that used to run their online business. The solution must start from the low pricing budget which is within USD100 using the AWS Learners Lab.

Task 2: Create a serverless architecture for automation (using a different AWS account)

1.	For the cloud solution associate with non-cybersecurity specialization background, you are required to help with additional services to the client to bring up their business operation website as soon as possible, by considering the “full stack serverless architecture”. Therefore, you need to research on Internet, on how to provide the client with full stack serverless architecture and recommend suitable web services to the client. If you able to implement a proof of concept of the full stack serverless architecture, it will be an added point in your yearly key performance.

1.	For the cloud solution associate with cybersecurity specialization background, you are required to help with additional services to the client, to provide “robust and advanced secured cloud environment” to avoid cybersecurity attack by considering the advanced security web services. Therefore, you need to research on Internet, on how to provide the client with advanced security cloud environment and recommend suitable web services. If you able to implement a proof of concept of the advanced secured architecture, it will be an added point in your yearly key performance.

By the end of this project, you should be able to deploy the AWS Cloud Architectural design principles that you learned in this course to:

•	Host a website that is created using PHP languages, to run on the AWS Cloud using Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance.

•	Use cloud database that support MySQL database provided in the database dump file, to query information.

REQUIREMENT!!!!

•	Provide secure access for an administrative user, using the least privileged access based on role for normal user

•	Provide anonymous security access to web users

•	Run the website on a t2.micro EC2 instance, and provide Secure Shell (SSH) access to administrators

•	Provide secure and reliable hosting of the MySQL database

•	Provide high availability to the website through an application load balancer 

•	Store database connection information in the AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store

•	Provide EC2 automatic scaling that uses an AMI launch template

•	Update the all the php files given with the latest version using Cloud9 IDE.

•	Amend the php script of the website (index.html) to include connect with cloud database.

•	Use the parameter below to connect with cloud database. Refer to php file (get-parameters.php) to understand how it is implemented.

The following parameters are used by the PHP application to connect to the database:

/example/endpoint

/example/username

/example/password

/example/database

Given files for your usage: 

1.	A SQL dump file that contains sample data

2.	A .zip file that contains the PHP and image files for the client website

Project deliverables

To complete this assignment, you must:

•	Deploy a PHP application that meets the system requirements outlined above using AWS Cloud. 

•	Submit a written report of the architecture solution that you implement to achieve the result.

•	Video recording of your project assets by demonstrating the AWS Cloud configuration, and the website ability to function and executed on cloud.

- Move a large database from AWS to a new server

- Allow the DB to be remotely accessible by providing the credentials in SSH key and UID + Pass 

- Update the connection string (script that allows us to connect to the database) of the website and another page so that they can point to the newly deployed database instead of the one available on AWS.

The reason why we would prefer to work with someone from Egypt is that the existing developer is from there and I think communication should be easier...

No fluff, no hype. Just a technical assessment of what (seems) to be working and exactly how it's being implemented. 

Some interesting questions

----------------------------------

What types of applications seem to be 'working' best? For example, narrow vs broad scope, highly generalizable vs deeply domain specific

Evaluation approaches: especially for factual accuracy and social bias. 

Endpoints: For industry applications that are intended to produce some kind of ROI/efficiency gains, are what are people turning to and why? (eg: openAI vs Anthropic vs Opensource/Meta)

How are RAG systems being set up. Architecture, indexing choices, hyperparamter optimization choices (eg chunking, reranking, etc), deployment patterns. Separate out single file upload patterns vs persistent knowledge base patterns if possible. 

What, if anything, is actually working for agent frameworks?Types and scope of agent tasks. Tooling: Dpsy vs langchain vs. crewai etc. What does the deployment stack look like?

-----------------------------

We can start simple and align before going deeper. I'll be available for repeated feedback along the way

Description:

We are looking for a python developer to join our team in developing a ai trading bot

You need to be an expert with python as well as familiar with cryptocurrency and crypto exchange api, WebSocket, k-lines. We will mostly be using Kucoin as api, WebSocket.

This job is for a long term position since we have a lot of project and each project will be paid minimum around 100$+

We will run a trial contract of 5$ at first to confirm your python skills, your knowledge, your efficiently, how clean you make your coding,etc.

Here is the summary for this trial contract

The goal of this bot is to engage in day trading with leverage, with a focus on managing risk through well-defined stop-loss and take-profit strategies. The bot aims to:

Open trades with a stop-loss set at approximately 0.5% in the opposite direction of the trade.

Set take-profit levels at around 1.5%.

This risk management strategy ensures that even if three trades hit the stop-loss, a single winning trade will recover the losses, maintaining overall profitability.

This strategy is designed to balance risk and reward effectively, aiming for a win ratio that allows the bot to remain profitable even with a series of losses.

Sample Plan

Data Collection from Futures Market (Completed)

- Objective: Ensure continuous real-time data fetching from the futures market.

- Method: Maintain an active WebSocket connection to collect and store incoming data for analysis.

Real-time Signal Generation

- Objective: Generate trading signals in real-time using the live data.

- Method: Implement signal generation logic to operate on real-time data as it is received, identifying trading signals based on technical indicators and patterns.

Simulated Trade Execution (backtest.py)

- Objective: Create a simulated trading environment to execute trades with fake money based on generated signals.

- Method:

- Track trades, including entry and exit points, stop-loss, and take-profit levels.

- Ensure that only one trade can be open at a time for both BTC and ETH. If the bot opens a long position on BTC, it cannot open another trade for BTC or ETH until the current trade is closed.

- This feature should already be implemented in the current backtest.py script.

Performance Monitoring (backtest.py)

- Objective: Continuously monitor the bot’s performance over a 5-day period.

- Method: Collect metrics such as profit/loss, win rate, number of trades executed, and other relevant statistics.

The bot runs data_collection_futures.py continuously to fetch real-time data from the futures market.

The bot runs real_time_signal_generation.py continuously to generate trading signals based on the real-time data it receives.

The bot runs backtest.py continuously to read the signals and execute simulated trades, tracking their outcomes.

This integrated approach ensures that the bot can trade effectively, using real-time data to generate signals and execute trades while continuously monitoring performance.","AI Bot,     AI App Development,     AI Model Integration,     Python,     Cryptocurrency,     API,     RESTful API    ",Full Stack Development,Canada,$100.00,,,https://www.upwork.com/ab/feed/jobs/rss?paging=NaN-undefined&payment_verified=1&q=(%22AI%20Engineer%22%20OR%20%22Data%20Engineer%22%20OR%20%22Cloud%20Engineer%22%20OR%20%22AWS%22%20OR%20%22Amazon%20Web%20Services%22%20OR%20%22Python%22%20OR%20%22Terraform%22%20OR%20%22DevOps%22%20OR%20%22SQL%22%20OR%20%22AWS%22%20OR%20%22Prompt%20Engineering%22)%20AND%20NOT%20(%22Google%20Cloud%22%20OR%20%22React%22%20OR%20%22Angular%22%20OR%20%22Tableau%22%20OR%20%22Ruby%22%20OR%20%22Laravel%22)&sort=recency&api_params=1&securityToken=75380e3d9358ff90936854a38a1b702b2f5e24519685701c6e412b66a48dccbca92f92dfdd61072831e978487b0af1f98ec0399c1771e068b429b47f60bb1d53&userUid=1771518215878287360&orgUid=1771518215878287361,,,,,

My goal is to grab that data and get it into csv file when they python script is run.

The script requires:

# Replace these with your credentials

access_token = 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'

ad_account_id = 'act_YOUR_AD_ACCOUNT_ID'

app_id = 'YOUR_APP_ID'

app_secret = 'YOUR_APP_SECRET'

However, I am not familiar with how to quickly obtain these. I am looking for someone very familiar with this process who can help me gain access to these things and get the script working asap. I am thinking it should only take 1-2 hours.

SQL Database Refinement - Upwork,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/SQL-Database-Refinement_%7E01a11e6abde20d3083?source=rss,6/5/2024 2:06pm,"I require a database that's compatible with Windows and Macintosh computers for use with Excel. 

Currently, I have a system with the following setup:

A SQLite DB on a Windows machine equipped with ODBC Drivers and macros in Excel.

The data to be updated comes from taxing authorities TAD.org on the following page ( https://www.tad.org/resources/data-downloads). The specific components to update are the residential features and values for the new years. This is done so that I can import the data into an Excel spreadsheet to identify the lowest possible values for contesting property values with the district.

I'm open to suggestions and have attached an Excel spreadsheet and the database to demonstrate their interaction and help determine the best options. Would like to be able to update the dataset without significant technical skills. Also, I would like a system that is expandable, as we will be increasing our database over the next year to include additional coverage areas, so would need to be scalable. 

In summary, I need a database that can be used on multiple operating systems with Excel installed. However, if there's a better alternative that allows for reporting without Excel on a server-side system or other, we are willing to consider that option as well.

I have attached an excel file so that you can see where the data flows into and the existing database so you can see the construct of that as well. Lastly, I have attached an output report that is provided by the district that the data will combat. 

Ideally I would like to touch as few keystrokes as possible and have a system that automatically provides the best/lowest values for comparable properties with my only need is to search for specific accounts that I need to access for review of the comparable properties.

I would like this completed within a week's timeframe if possible.

The application will run primarily on a PC using a Microsoft SQL Express database as the data storage system

The application requires the ability to discover devices through modbus queries and add them to the HMI.  The devices being added report temperature, pressure, battery level and several other sensor readings.  As the devices are discovered, the user will be given the opportunity to add them to the monitoring panel.  The devices will report back in real time on sensor reading and the values will be used to set alarms and alert the operator of certain conditions.  The application will need to generate reports and provide diagnostic data collected from the devices. Some helper functions have been written in Python.

I have created a significant portion of this application including the SQL interface, some of the screens, the communication interface and much of the VBscript, so there is a fairly well established framework from which to build upon

The developer should be fluent in Blue Open Studio and have done several projects involving multiple communication drivers, vbscript and classes.  There will be a requirement to write visual basic code to provide some of the functionality. Phython, C++, and Excel are definite assets.

The developer will need to be available on this platform with both audio and video. The successful applicant will be working with a Team in North America, so the ability to meet during standard North American hours is required.

Successful completion of this project will lead to several other projects of this nature.

"Extracting Features From News Data - OpenAI API, PostgreSql - Upwork",https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Extracting-Features-From-News-Data-OpenAI-API-PostgreSql_%7E0121e35b14fead8778?source=rss,6/5/2024 12:57pm,"This project focuses on extracting specific AI-related features from news articles and storing the parsed information in a PostgreSQL database. The articles are related to specific companies, identified by their company name and stock symbol. The extracted features include AI R&D spending, AI patents, AI research publications, AI product announcements, AI infrastructure investment, and AI talent.

Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to process news articles, extract relevant AI-related information, and store the parsed data in the appropriate database tables. The key components of the project are:

1) News articles database table (news_articles):

-Contains metadata such as id, url, date, and symbol (used to identify the company).

-Stores the full text of the article in the full_text column.

-Includes a llm_full_text_summary column to store a summary of the article generated by a language model.

2.) AI feature extraction:

-Utilizes OpenAI's ChatCompletion API to extract information related to specific AI categories.

-Parses the API response to identify relevant data points.

-Determines the type of information (quarterly, annual, or event-specific) and associates it with the corresponding company.

3.) Database integration:

-Inserts the extracted AI feature data into the respective database tables:

--ai_rd_spending: AI R&D spending data

--ai_patents: AI patent data

--ai_research_publications: AI research publication data

--ai_product_announcements: AI product announcement data

--ai_infrastructure_investment: AI infrastructure investment data

--ai_talent: AI talent data

Each table includes columns for the company symbol, data type (quarterly, annual, event-specific), year, quarter, event date, category, value, URL, and date.

4.) Database Schema

The project utilizes a PostgreSQL database with the following tables:

--news_articles: Stores the news articles and their metadata.

--ai_rd_spending: Stores AI R&D spending data.

--ai_patents: Stores AI patent data.

--ai_research_publications: Stores AI research publication data.

--ai_product_announcements: Stores AI product announcement data.

--ai_infrastructure_investment: Stores AI infrastructure investment data.

--ai_talent: Stores AI talent data.

The database connection is established using psycopg2 and SQLAlchemy libraries.

Project Status and Future Enhancements

Currently, the project has the core business logic implemented, including the database schema, OpenAI ChatCompletion API integration, and basic data parsing. However, some areas need further development and refinement:

-Improve the parsing logic to accurately extract AI feature data from the ChatCompletion API responses.

-Ensure proper insertion of parsed data into the respective database tables.

-Handle edge cases and error scenarios gracefully.

This contract will only be completed and paid if the parsing of openAI response for the news articles correctly works and inserts the expected data into it's respective database tables. All the same libraries and coding structure as the current code must be used and only extending any existing logic to enhance the functionality from some of the bugs it currently gets.",Python    ,Data Extraction,United States,$210.00,,,https://www.upwork.com/ab/feed/jobs/rss?paging=NaN-undefined&payment_verified=1&q=(%22AI%20Engineer%22%20OR%20%22Data%20Engineer%22%20OR%20%22Cloud%20Engineer%22%20OR%20%22AWS%22%20OR%20%22Amazon%20Web%20Services%22%20OR%20%22Python%22%20OR%20%22Terraform%22%20OR%20%22DevOps%22%20OR%20%22SQL%22%20OR%20%22AWS%22%20OR%20%22Prompt%20Engineering%22)%20AND%20NOT%20(%22Google%20Cloud%22%20OR%20%22React%22%20OR%20%22Angular%22%20OR%20%22Tableau%22%20OR%20%22Ruby%22%20OR%20%22Laravel%22)&sort=recency&api_params=1&securityToken=75380e3d9358ff90936854a38a1b702b2f5e24519685701c6e412b66a48dccbca92f92dfdd61072831e978487b0af1f98ec0399c1771e068b429b47f60bb1d53&userUid=1771518215878287360&orgUid=1771518215878287361,,,,,

I am trying to automate the invoice generation process. - Upwork,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/trying-automate-the-invoice-generation-process_%7E01b3bcdd8e0eb139a8?source=rss,6/5/2024 12:50pm,"Jakub,

I found this info on another web sit which is what i am looking to accomplish. 

In this tutorial, we will also be using types, as we will show you how to manage types in Python. Our data shows how we describe our object of invoice. These are the fields we will be taking from the CSV file and we will keep them here. So, we’ll have two classes - CSVParser and ApiConnector.

We will have the main logic here - underneath the two classes we just mentioned. The first class, CSVParser will be the one responsible for reading all the data from the CSV file and converting it to a list of invoice classes. Then, the APIConnector class will allow us to get the data class invoice and send it to the target API, get the data (the content of the PDF), and save it as a PDF file.

As you can see, if we type “python automate.py file.csv”, it will run with the “file.csv” already here. So, it is a super simple command-line interface.

2. Setting up API Connector

So, let’s start with the API Connector.

Reading and parsing the data is not less important at this point. Right now, we want to focus on “making the magic”. So, this is what creating types mean. Here, we can define what we accept as a return from this function and we want the init to return no values.

3. The two functions

Our invoice generator script will have two functions.

The first one will be a “bigger” one, and the second will be a more specific function that will use the first one. The first function is the one that connects and saves. The second one is for saving again.

As arguments, you can also see that we are passing the invoice, from which we expect these objects of the data class. Now, it’s very important to mention that we need to parse it. When we send the JSON file to the backend (the API), it accepts these fields here. Whenever we create a “from” field in Python, it’s already a used keyword so we have to go with “from_who”.

4. Testing the script with manually inputted information

We use prepared invoice information for testing the invoice generator. This is also the way we will be reading the invoice from the CSV file. Now, the second step would be to actually read this information from a CSV file, iterate over it and generate multiple invoices.

Okay, so this is how our function presents:‍We are opening the file - quite obvious.‍We are using the dictionary reader - a function for the CSV file.‍It takes the fields of the columns and creates the dictionary immediately after reading the file.

Let’s run it!

First, let’s focus on just reading the CSV file and getting the objects.

So, we do “python”, basically, if you do “automate.py” as an argument it will take “invoices.csv” but we can also type it here.

I also need someone who preferably has experience with SQLMesh and Dagster

The actual work will be working with a client - they want to consolidate their data layer. Currently they are using SQL inside a propietary software. They also have a team that works with raw SQL. Anytime they need the SQL they extract the proprietary SQL and then work on transforming it to the SQL they need. There is also a good bit of python work that is happening, so I need you to be flexible. It's very heavy in SQL so ensure that you can live and breathe SQL.

You will be working alongside me to do work for a client I have. I'm looking for someone I can rely on. Every day we will sync up, I will give you tasks, and you will complete them and hand it to me and I will deliver it to the client.

The workflow:

- I attend meetings to understand requirements

- I send you recording of the meetings and we talk about what you need to complete for the day

- You do the task and write out every step you took. In the end you will make a recording detailing your steps.

- Once completed, we will do a code review. If all looks good, we have the handoff and I will give you your next assignment.

I want to work with someone who is available to work US Eastern Time (EST) time zone 10 am - 5 pm EST. You would be working with me for a few hours a day, five days a week. It would be a fixed weekly rate. If I really like you I would bring you onto my consultancy for a longer term. I anticipate maybe 15-20 hours of true work but it could be less.

I WANT to find a developer I can depend on and trust. This initial project with the hourly rate is just to try this approach out. If I can depend and trust you and your code is good, then we will set a weekly rate that will keep both of us happy. My goal is to have a multi-year (and more) relationship with you where I can promise you that you will be paid every week. Especially in this economy it’s really good to have a consistent salary. But the initial step will be to try this out with an hourly rate. I’ve been doing this for a while and if you stick with me i’ll make sure you always have money coming in.

Does this sound interesting to you? If so, let me know what you expect the rate to be per week.

Lastly, this is a dealbreaker for many so I want to make sure I am clear: THIS WILL require you to have really good internet speeds (in the 100s Mbps) hardwired in. Because I will need you to work on a remote machine. I know this is a dealbreaker for many because of slowness but this is my requirement. I will *not* be sending you any code to work on your machine.

We can try workarounds if I really like you but my requirement is that you must be willing and able to work on a remote machine.

I hope this message finds you well.

I am reaching out to inquire about automating a specific process using PowerBI within a 24-hour period, on a recurring daily basis. The goal is to streamline our data management and reporting workflow. Below are the detailed requirements:

Database Access:

PowerBI should connect to our SQL database

The connection needs to be established and refreshed every 24 hours.

Data Extraction:

Defined data elements need to be extracted from the SQL database.

These elements should be specified and configured within PowerBI.

Data Export:

The extracted data should be exported from PowerBI to a CSV file.

The CSV file must adhere to a specific format and be readable by Excel.

Ensure proper delimiters and encoding to maintain compatibility with Excel.

Email Distribution:

PowerBI should automatically send the generated CSV file to a specific email address.

This process should occur within each 24-hour period, ensuring the recipient receives the updated data daily.

Automation Continuity:

The entire process should repeat every 24 hours, ensuring the automation runs continuously without manual intervention.

We would like to understand if this is feasible with PowerBI and if you can assist us in setting up this automation. Additionally, please provide an estimated timeline and cost for this project.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,

Patrick

I have been monitoring mongodb with Datadog for years. Even though there have been occasional problems for 3 years, I have managed to cope so far without a problem in general. Now I don't want to postpone some problems and I need an expert to solve them.

Problem 1) The issue I'm facing is that my EC2 server, which is 125 GB in size, is 90 GB full. However, when I log on to the server using SSH, I see that only 20 GB of that space is being utilized by the database. The server's size has been increased from its initial 50 GB to 85 GB, and now to 125 GB, but the database hasn't grown proportionately. I can't figure out why the SSD requires more space over time. Even though I suspect that logs and similar files may be the cause, I haven't been able to solve this problem.

Problem 2) With Datadog, I can see in real time what query comes to the db and there are two uncertain points when I look at my current load. There are 2 queries and it constitutes more than 75% of my mongodb traffic ""blocked-resource"" and ""ismaster admin.$cmd"". Video explanation: https://www.loom.com/share/84a3fe9cf92749eea52a684ae739283a

I want to understand and fix these queries.

Problem 3) As far as I control Datadog, we really have very little use, but why are we using between 50-70% of CPU of for a server with 8GB 4CPU, how can this be? Maybe datadog queries are misleading me and we need to install a different tool directly on the server and provide a different analysis.

I would like to check all of these and fix the situations by doing meets with me. Before you apply for the job, share with me what your work process will be, what permissions you will ask for, and if you will use a performance tracking tool and I can understand how the process will work and make my choice accordingly.

2. Move.java

3. VDMException.java

4. RobotMonitorGUI.java

5. RunRobotGUI.java

6. RunRobotText.java

The RobotMonitor.java file is an incomplete Java implementation of the

RobotMonitor model discussed above. Complete the implementation of this

RobotMonitor.java class, being sure to use defensive programming techniques.

You can test this class by running it alongside the additional classes provided. If

you are using a desktop Java IDE (such as NetBeans or eclipse) you can use the

GUI interface to test your RobotMonitor.java class by running the

RunRobotMonitorGUI.java file. 

If you do not have access to a Java IDE such as NetBeans, you may use a web-based Java tool (such as JDoodle). Web-based Java tools such as JDoodle cannot

run programs with a GUI interface, so to test your RobotMonitor.java class use

the text based tester fie RunRobotMonitorText.java.

Submit the following files

• your completed RobotMonitor.rtf VDM specification file

• your RobotMonitor testing documentation

• your updated test data file

• your completed RobotMonitor.java class file.

   

Write a report with the following title:

“Formal Methods for Computer Science Professionals”.

The report should reflect on the legal, social, ethical and professional reasons for

Computer Science Professionals to use formal methods to develop high integrity

software and make reference to your RobotMonitor project to identify how formal

methods were used to improve the quality of the final software.

Your report should include references that are presented in Harvard referencing

style.

I am looking to have a proof-of-concept created of a platform that combines a few elements I am already doing manually (using various platforms to do so) to create an easy to use tool to help me manage my stock portfolio.  What the tool should be able to do in its most basic form:

1) Connect to my broker to get data about my portfolio.  What positions are owned, buy price, date, profit/loss, etc

2) Feed that data into the ChatGPT AI model

3) Get management advice for each position based on some guiding criteria (risk tolerance, looking to maximize profit or minimize risk, capital willing to risk, etc).  I can provide some prompt guidance and training so that the AI is doing the correct thing

4) Get pricing data for the strategies suggested.  The AI may suggest, for example, to buy a put at certain strike.  We need to be able to get the price of that put option to understand the profit/loss scenarios.

5) a simple streamlined outline of each suggested strategy for each position.  The AI, in my manual testing, often gives options so would be good to outline these very simply

6) Include max profit / max loss calculations for each strategy suggested

7) some ability to ask questions about the strategies and or ask for changes/tweaks

This is mostly connecting API's and doing math against the data retrieved and then providing the results in an easy to use format.

 

Technical Experience Requirements:

- ChatGPT API

- stock broker API connection (get requests)

- Web application development

- Data management in cloud

Right now this is just for my use.  But I do want the ability to have it be scalable so if I want to add users, make it a full product, etc that I can do that without having to redo everything.","JavaScript,     Artificial Intelligence,     API,     Python,     Web Application    ",Full Stack Development,United States,$500.00,,,https://www.upwork.com/ab/feed/jobs/rss?paging=NaN-undefined&payment_verified=1&q=(%22AI%20Engineer%22%20OR%20%22Data%20Engineer%22%20OR%20%22Cloud%20Engineer%22%20OR%20%22AWS%22%20OR%20%22Amazon%20Web%20Services%22%20OR%20%22Python%22%20OR%20%22Terraform%22%20OR%20%22DevOps%22%20OR%20%22SQL%22%20OR%20%22AWS%22%20OR%20%22Prompt%20Engineering%22)%20AND%20NOT%20(%22Google%20Cloud%22%20OR%20%22React%22%20OR%20%22Angular%22%20OR%20%22Tableau%22%20OR%20%22Ruby%22%20OR%20%22Laravel%22)&sort=recency&api_params=1&securityToken=75380e3d9358ff90936854a38a1b702b2f5e24519685701c6e412b66a48dccbca92f92dfdd61072831e978487b0af1f98ec0399c1771e068b429b47f60bb1d53&userUid=1771518215878287360&orgUid=1771518215878287361,,,,,

Building an AI-Powered Virtual Interview Platform - Upwork,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Building-Powered-Virtual-Interview-Platform_%7E0174cbcfaa4b47b260?source=rss,6/5/2024 9:24am,"Dear Freelancer,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss an exciting project opportunity and to see if you would be interested in collaborating with us.

Our vision is to create an innovative, AI-driven virtual interview platform that empowers job seekers to improve their interview skills and connects employers with top talent. We believe that this platform has the potential to revolutionize the job search and hiring process.

A key differentiator of our platform is the integration of advanced AI technology. We have partnered with Claude, a state-of-the-art AI assistant developed by Anthropic. Claude's capabilities in natural language processing, machine learning, and data analysis will be instrumental in powering the core functionalities of our platform.

For the initial phase of the project, we are focusing on developing the following features:

Virtual Interview Simulator:

Job seekers can participate in realistic, AI-generated mock interviews tailored to their job preferences.

Claude will analyze the candidate's performance and provide detailed feedback and recommendations for improvement.

Interview data for top-performing candidates will be stored in a searchable database.

Comprehensive Candidate Evaluation:

Online Assessments: Candidates will complete a series of online tests to assess their skills, knowledge, and aptitude relevant to their desired job roles. Claude will analyze the test results and generate insights into the candidate's strengths and areas for improvement.

Facial Analysis during Video Interviews: We will utilize advanced facial recognition and analysis techniques to evaluate the candidate's facial expressions, eye movements, and overall demeanor during the virtual interviews. This data will be processed by Claude to provide an in-depth understanding of the candidate's confidence, engagement, and communication skills.

Behavioral and Psychological Insights: Claude will analyze the candidate's responses, language patterns, and behavioral cues to assess their personality traits, emotional intelligence, and potential fit within specific job roles and company cultures.

Employer Access to Talent Pool:

Companies can subscribe to the platform to access the database of pre-vetted, high-performing candidates.

They can search for candidates based on specific criteria and view their comprehensive evaluation reports, including interview performance, assessment results, and behavioral insights.

This will allow employers to make data-driven hiring decisions and identify the most suitable candidates for their organization.

From a technical perspective, we envision the following key components:

Interactive web platform with user dashboards for job seekers and employers

Integration of Claude's AI capabilities for interview question generation, candidate performance analysis, and insights

Secure video interview interface with real-time facial analysis and language processing powered by Claude

Scalable database to store user profiles, assessment results, interview data, and evaluation reports

Messaging and notification system for communication between candidates and employers

We are looking for a skilled freelance developer to help us bring this vision to life. Your role would be to work closely with our team to design and develop the platform, integrate Claude's AI components seamlessly, and ensure a smooth user experience.

If this opportunity aligns with your expertise and interests, we would be delighted to discuss further details and explore how we can collaborate effectively. Please let me know if you have any questions or if you would like to schedule a call to discuss the project in more depth.

Thank you for considering this opportunity. I look forward to the possibility of working together to create a truly innovative and impactful platform.

I need to install an authentification process + be able to retrieve infos with webhook.

Python Developer for Survey Report Generation Tool using (AI) - Upwork,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Python-Developer-for-Survey-Report-Generation-Tool-using_%7E010a4f75dc3bc44710?source=rss,6/5/2024 7:40am,"Project Overview:

We aim to develop a sophisticated desktop application designed to streamline our survey reporting process. This application will extract data from survey responses, accurately matching these responses with corresponding recommendations. By leveraging AI, we seek to enhance the analysis and ensure that the recommendations align seamlessly with our established templates. The ultimate objective is to compile these matched responses and recommendations into a comprehensive and cohesive report. Although we have preliminary code that addresses part of this functionality, we are seeking a professional to refine and expand upon it, creating a robust solution that can be easily utilized by other team members for generating recommendation reports.

Objectives:

PDF Data Extraction:

Develop functionality to extract text data from PDF survey reports using libraries like PyPDF2.

Identify and parse relevant survey responses, particularly focusing on questions marked with a ""No"" response.

Word Document Processing:

Implement functionality to read and process Word documents containing recommendations using python-docx.

Extract recommendations based on question numbers to match them with the survey responses from the PDFs.

AI Integration:

Integrate OpenAI's GPT-4.0 API to enhance the extraction and processing of data.

Use AI to accurately identify and match survey responses with the appropriate recommendations.

Data Compilation:

Match extracted survey responses with corresponding recommendations.

Compile the matched data into an Excel report using Pandas.

GUI Development:

Create a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter or a similar library.

Allow users to upload PDF and Word files, process the data, and download the compiled report.

Error Handling and Robustness:

Implement comprehensive error handling to ensure the application is robust and user-friendly.

Provide clear error messages and guidance for users when issues arise.

The approach I've outlined is merely a suggestion. If you have alternative methods to achieve the same objective, I would be very interested in hearing them.

File Types to be supported : 

1) .pdf, .pptx, .docx, .txt, .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .html, .json, .log, .cfg, etc

2) Audio (.mp3, .wav, etc), 

3) Codes (.py, .java, .cpp, .c, etc)

Processing these files requires better document (1) Layout extraction (2) Accurate OCR.

Requirements : 

Also for images or for files where there are visual representations, need to understand the whole context properly and not just OCR.

For example : 

Need to get all the information from the above graph in a proper interpretable text format so we can later answer questions such as “which one’s make in UK but Natural?”, etc

For now, these kind of interpretabilities looks to be possible only through Visual Language Models (VLM). In case of approaches using VLM, keep in mind that the model used should not be too heavy or GPU intensive as the eventual goal is to have everything locally.

1. Characteristics

• User Profile Setup: Create a user-friendly interface for users to input their medication details, including dosage, frequency, and specific instructions.

• Personalized Reminders: Implement an agent that adapts to the individual’s medication regimen and sends personalized reminders based on the medication schedule. The method of sending reminders is pending.

• Adaptive Feedback: Allow the agent to provide adaptive feedback based on user interactions. For example, if a user consistently takes medications on time, the agent can offer positive reinforcement.

2. Challenges and Extensions

• Privacy and Security Measures: Implement measures to ensure the privacy and security of user data.

• User Engagement Features: Add rewards and adjust it to a gamification status to enhance user engagement with the app and encourage consistent use.

3. Algorithm for Agent Implementation

Utilize a simple rule-based algorithm for personalized medication reminders. The algorithm considers user input, medication details, and past adherence behavior to optimize the timing and reminders.

4. Data/Simulator

• Data: User-provided medication details and adherence history.

• Simulator: A basic simulation environment for testing the agent’s functionality and user interactions.

5. Programming Language/Software Package

• Programming Language: Python (?)

• Software Package: Use a lightweight framework for building conversational agents, such as Chatter- Bot or simple chatbot libraries.","PHP,     Node.js,     Python,     HTML5,     MySQL    ",Full Stack Development,Greece,$50.00,,,https://www.upwork.com/ab/feed/jobs/rss?paging=NaN-undefined&payment_verified=1&q=(%22AI%20Engineer%22%20OR%20%22Data%20Engineer%22%20OR%20%22Cloud%20Engineer%22%20OR%20%22AWS%22%20OR%20%22Amazon%20Web%20Services%22%20OR%20%22Python%22%20OR%20%22Terraform%22%20OR%20%22DevOps%22%20OR%20%22SQL%22%20OR%20%22AWS%22%20OR%20%22Prompt%20Engineering%22)%20AND%20NOT%20(%22Google%20Cloud%22%20OR%20%22React%22%20OR%20%22Angular%22%20OR%20%22Tableau%22%20OR%20%22Ruby%22%20OR%20%22Laravel%22)&sort=recency&api_params=1&securityToken=75380e3d9358ff90936854a38a1b702b2f5e24519685701c6e412b66a48dccbca92f92dfdd61072831e978487b0af1f98ec0399c1771e068b429b47f60bb1d53&userUid=1771518215878287360&orgUid=1771518215878287361,,,,,

I need an experienced developer to code up a Twitter giveaway bot.

I need an experienced developer to create a Twitter giveaway bot. The bot should be able to perform the following actions:

- Follow the person posting a tweet

- Retweet that Twitter post

- Like the said post

- Tag a friend(or two)

- Click on the YouTube link in the Twitter post

- Subscribe to the YouTube channel whose link it is

- Like the YouTube video in question

- Comment on the same YouTube video

- Screenshot the comment left on the YouTube video

- Comment on the initial Twitter post with the captured screenshot

While performing all this, you should make sure NOT to get the Twitter account banned. There needs to be a limit to how fast the bot operates so it remains undetectable by Twitter. I have provided you with examples of what these Twitter giveaways usually look like. These may differ, meaning you're not required every time to perform all of the actions I had described above. There needs to be a mechanism to check which of the actions are required in the Twitter giveaway, so I'm assuming you need to code up some text recognition or keyword searches as well. For example, some giveaways do not have a YT link at all, or they don't require you to tag a friend etc.","Scripting,     Automation,     Selenium,     Python,     API,     Bot    ",Scripting & Automation,Serbia,$50.00,,,https://www.upwork.com/ab/feed/jobs/rss?paging=NaN-undefined&payment_verified=1&q=(%22AI%20Engineer%22%20OR%20%22Data%20Engineer%22%20OR%20%22Cloud%20Engineer%22%20OR%20%22AWS%22%20OR%20%22Amazon%20Web%20Services%22%20OR%20%22Python%22%20OR%20%22Terraform%22%20OR%20%22DevOps%22%20OR%20%22SQL%22%20OR%20%22AWS%22%20OR%20%22Prompt%20Engineering%22)%20AND%20NOT%20(%22Google%20Cloud%22%20OR%20%22React%22%20OR%20%22Angular%22%20OR%20%22Tableau%22%20OR%20%22Ruby%22%20OR%20%22Laravel%22)&sort=recency&api_params=1&securityToken=75380e3d9358ff90936854a38a1b702b2f5e24519685701c6e412b66a48dccbca92f92dfdd61072831e978487b0af1f98ec0399c1771e068b429b47f60bb1d53&userUid=1771518215878287360&orgUid=1771518215878287361,,,,,

12. Provide backup of the entire server including the database at the end of the project

13. Compress the XML sitemap into “.xml.gz” format

Here is my advice, however, I am open to suggestions:

————————————

To optimize Elasticsearch and database performance for 100 concurrent users, you would have to implement the following strategies and techniques:

1. Index Optimization:

- Use appropriate index mapping types (e.g., keyword, text, long) for fields.

- Enable index compression and refresh intervals.

- Use index aliases for efficient querying.

2. Query Optimization:

- Use efficient query types (e.g., term, phrase, match) and avoid slow queries (e.g., regex, wildcard).

- Implement query filtering and caching.

- Use search templates for reusable queries.

3. Database Configuration:

- Adjust JVM heap size and garbage collection settings.

- Configure disk storage and I/O settings for optimal performance.

- Enable database monitoring and alerting.

4. Caching and Buffering:

- Implement caching layers (e.g., Varnish, Redis, Memcached) for frequent queries.

- Use buffer sizes and queue capacities to manage concurrent requests.

5. Monitoring and Analytics:

- Set up monitoring tools (e.g., Kibana, Grafana) for performance insights.

- Track query performance, latency, and error rates.

6. Load Balancing:

- Use load balancers (e.g., HAProxy, NGINX) to distribute incoming traffic.

7. Content Delivery Network (CDN):

- Consider using a CDN to offload static asset delivery and reduce database queries such as BunnyCDN.

————————————

Here's a high-level overview of the setup process for each component on a Hetzner dedicated server:

Database Server (MySQL/PostgreSQL)

1. Install the database server software (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL) using the package manager.

2. Configure the database server settings (e.g., database name, user credentials, storage engine) in the configuration files (e.g., my.cnf or postgresql.conf).

3. Create the necessary databases and users.

4. Configure any necessary database settings (e.g., character encoding, timezone).

5. Restart the database server service to apply changes.

Elastic Search Server

1. Install Elastic Search using the package manager or by downloading and installing the binaries.

2. Configure Elastic Search settings (e.g., cluster name, node name, index settings) in the configuration files (e.g., elasticsearch.yml).

3. Set up index mapping and analysis settings.

4. Configure any necessary plugins (e.g., Kibana, X-Pack).

5. Restart the Elastic Search service to apply changes.

Redis Cache

1. Install Redis using the package manager or by downloading and installing the binaries.

2. Configure Redis settings (e.g., port number, memory allocation, persistence) in the configuration files (e.g., redis.conf).

3. Set up any necessary Redis databases or instances.

4. Configure any necessary Redis settings (e.g., expiration policies, eviction policies).

5. Restart the Redis service to apply changes.

Varnish Cache

1. Install Varnish using the package manager or by downloading and installing the binaries.

2. Configure Varnish settings (e.g., port number, cache size, backend servers) in the configuration files (e.g., varnish.conf).

3. Set up any necessary Varnish caching rules or policies.

4. Configure any necessary Varnish settings (e.g., TTL, grace period).

5. Restart the Varnish service to apply changes.

Load Balancer (HAProxy/NGINX)

1. Install the load balancer software (e.g., HAProxy or NGINX) using the package manager.

2. Configure the load balancer settings (e.g., backend servers, balancing algorithm, health checks) in the configuration files (e.g., haproxy.cfg or nginx.conf).

3. Set up any necessary load balancing rules or policies.

4. Configure any necessary load balancer settings (e.g., session persistence, connection timeouts).

5. Restart the load balancer service to apply changes.

————————————

To ensure efficient page load times and high search performance, I would take the following measures:

1. Optimize Database Queries:

- Use efficient query algorithms and indexing.

- Limit database queries and use caching where possible.

- Optimize database server configuration and resources.

2. Implement Caching:

- Use Redis or Memcached for caching frequently accessed data.

- Implement page caching and fragment caching.

- Use CDN for static asset caching.

3. Optimize Elastic Search:

- Use appropriate indexing and mapping strategies.

- Optimize search queries and filtering.

- Use Elastic Search caching and warming.

4. Optimize Web Server Configuration:

- Use efficient web server software (e.g., Nginx).

- Configure optimal server settings (e.g., worker processes, connection timeouts).

- Enable HTTP/2 and SSL/TLS.

5. Enable Browser Caching:

- Set appropriate cache headers for static assets.

- Enable browser caching for frequently accessed resources.

6. Minify and Compress Files:

- Minify and compress JavaScript and CSS files.

- Use image compression tools (e.g., WebP).

7. Optimize Server Resources:

- Ensure sufficient CPU, memory, and disk resources.

- Monitor server performance and adjust resources as needed.

8. Use Load Balancing and Autoscaling:

- Distribute traffic across multiple servers.

- Scale servers based on traffic demand.

9. Monitor Performance:

- Use tools like New Relic, Datadog, or Prometheus to monitor performance.

- Track page load times, search performance, and server resources.

Here are some open-source control panels for server monitoring, backup management, and restoration: I NEED YOUR SUGGESTION ON THIS.

1. Webmin: A web-based interface for system administration, including monitoring, backup, and restoration.

2. Zabbix: A comprehensive monitoring tool for servers, networks, and applications.

3. Bareos (Backup Archiving Recovery Open Sourced): A backup and archiving solution with a web-based interface.

4. Duplicati: A backup client that supports various storage providers, including local disks and cloud services.

5. Areca Backup: A Java-based backup solution with a web interface and support for various storage devices.

6.	Bacula

For RAID configuration and weekly automatic backups, you can follow these general steps:

RAID Configuration:

1. Install the necessary RAID software (e.g., mdadm for Linux).

2. Configure the RAID array using the software (e.g., create a RAID 1 or 5 array).

3. Monitor the RAID array for errors and alerts.

Weekly Automatic Backups:

1. Install the backup software (e.g., Bareos, Duplicati, or Areca Backup).

2. Configure the backup job to run weekly, using a scheduler like cron (for Linux).

3. Set the backup source to the desired data (e.g., /home, /var, or specific directories).

4. Choose the backup destination (e.g., local disk, network share, or cloud storage).

5. Configure retention policies and backup verification options.

6. Monitor backup logs and alerts for errors or issues.

Some specific configuration examples:

- Webmin: Create a backup job in the ""System"" then ""Backup"" module, selecting the desired directories and destination.

- Bareos: Create a backup job in the ""Jobs"" tab, specifying the source and destination, and scheduling it using the ""Schedule"" tab.

- Duplicati: Create a backup job in the ""Backup"" tab, selecting the source and destination, and scheduling it using the ""Schedules"" tab.

Timelines: 2 - 3 weeks

Developer Needed for CSV to JSON Transformation and High-Volume Data Serving - Upwork,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Developer-Needed-for-CSV-JSON-Transformation-and-High-Volume-Data-Serving_%7E014ae62e0bd8931ba4?source=rss,6/5/2024 5:52am,"We are seeking an experienced developer to help us create a serverless application within our AWS environment. The goal of this project is to periodically retrieve a CSV file from a URL, store it in S3, transform its content into a JSON feed, and efficiently serve individual objects from this feed via a query string. The response should be cached to handle high-volume traffic.

Project Requirements:

1. Retrieve CSV File:

   - Periodically download a CSV file from a specified URL.

   - Store the downloaded CSV file in an S3 bucket.

2. Transform CSV to JSON:

   - Parse the CSV content and transform it into a JSON format.

   - Each row in the CSV should be converted to a JSON object with an added unique identifier (`id`).

3. Serve JSON Data:

   - Create a function to retrieve a specific object from the JSON array based on a query string parameter (e.g., `?id=3`).

   - If no matching object is found, the function should return a random object from the array.

4. Cache Responses:

   - Implement caching for the responses to ensure the solution can handle high-volume HTTP traffic.

   - The cache should be invalidated and updated whenever the CSV file is re-downloaded and processed.

Technical Requirements:

- The solution should be built using AWS services, ideally leveraging serverless technologies such as AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and S3.

- The application should be designed for scalability and efficiency, ensuring minimal latency for data retrieval.

- Proper error handling and logging should be implemented for monitoring and troubleshooting purposes.

Deliverables:

- A fully functional serverless application deployed in our AWS environment.

- Source code with clear documentation.

- Configuration and deployment instructions.

- A brief test plan to verify the functionality of the application.

Skills Required:

- Proficiency in AWS services (Lambda, S3, API Gateway, etc.)

- Experience with serverless application development

- Strong understanding of JSON and CSV data formats

- Expertise in caching strategies for high-volume traffic

My name is Alessandro and I am working on developing a software which can automate the process of making ‘every touch videos’ for athletes. Basically, I want to be able to input my shirt number and the link to the full sports match and the software will output a finished video of every time that player touched the ball in that match. I have a prototype that is able to distinguish the 22 players on the pitch and the ball with 85% accuracy. I need to build on this and ideally have this done in 2-3 weeks. I would love to talk more about this and how we can achieve this.

I look forward to hearing from you.

BO means the bayesian optimization

so, i use the encoder which has attention layer and deepsets layer combined. 

So, data for BO would be fed into encoder, and given to RL (PPO) and RL would make actions based on his policy.

and when the action is made, GP(Gaussian process model) will act as an environment, give the next state and reward.

and i want both encoder and RL agent will be trained with this reward.

so, at the running.py, this part should be coded again

News scraping and comparison application development - Upwork,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/News-scraping-and-comparison-application-development_%7E01c2c05b313090398c?source=rss,6/5/2024 4:41am,"We are looking for a skilled developer to create an application/software that can scrape news articles and compare them with domestic news outlets. 

Example, Reuters and Bloomberg publish around 40k articles each day. Local media like Nos.nl and Nu.nl (The Netherlands) only publish around 2k. This means a lot of news is not published in the Netherlands and not accessible without paying e.g. Reuters and Bloomberg. The idea is to create an application that compares the articles, removes articles that have already been published in the Netherlands, removes articles like columns and documentaries and thus leaves 'the news from yesterday'. These articles then need to be uploaded to a website where they can be viewed. 

The goal is to generate a comprehensive news report from the previous day with articles that local news outlets have missed. The application should have the following capabilities:

- Efficiently scrape news articles from various sources

- Compare the scraped articles with domestic news outlets

- Identify and eliminate duplicate articles

- Categorize the articles based on their topic

- Generate a consolidated news report for the previous day

Skills needed:

- Web scraping

- Data comparison and analysis

- Article categorization

- Report generation

This is a medium-sized project and is expected to take around 1 to 3 months to complete. We are looking for an intermediate-level developer with experience in developing similar applications. We first want to get an idea of costs and whether it is possible before we continue with the project.

Feel free to send proposals and/or applications + your rate/budget.

I currently work with a fintech as a financial analyst and I have a non-compete. However, I just came across an opportunity to offer corporate checking account with cash management services for corporate clients. It will come with full service banking accounts and sub accounts. We have sampled some customers to find out their corporate banking needs and the banking service we

will work with can provide all, however the most important part of it is allowing our corporate customers connect their bank accounts t

o services with aggregators such as plaid, dwolla and finicity e.t.c.

I do not have the technical know how but I have the idea of getting yields and high interests for clients on their deposits. We do have family and friends ready to fund and back the project however, we need to present the project to them, so we need to make a ""demo"" version of the service.

The budget for this (everything, again everything start to finish) $1,500. 

What we need, a full banking fintech website (front end and back end). With the following abilities

1. Bank website front end and back end.

2. Sign up and User dashboards to login

3. Ability to feed transaction into the user dashboard with CSV or Excel or google sheets generate monthly bank statements from CSV or excel or spread sheets or any financial transaction base we decide to us.

4. Ability to use CSV or Excel or google sheets generate PDF

bank statements (monthly or over a custom period)

from the user dashboard using transactions already uploaded to it with CSV or excel or spread sheets or any financial transaction base we decide to us.

5. The ability to let our clients use plaid and other data aggregators as these seems to be top priority for them. we want to be a plaid supported Financial institution.

Our questions:

Can you handle this?

How much will it cost us?

How long will it take?

It is a demo project to be able to raise money and the total budget for everything is $1,500

I currently have a developer you will work with too (if you want to).

Software developer to build IDE for data engineering and analysis - Upwork,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Software-developer-build-IDE-for-data-engineering-and-analysis_%7E01eef1ba082d840a93?source=rss,6/5/2024 4:37am,"I'm looking for a software engineer for part-time to work on an Integrated Development Environment specifically designed for SQL data analysis and data engineering.

PROJECT BACKGROUND

The IDE will leverage computational tree analysis, machine learning, and large language models to analyse the code base and data model to extract business logic and reason about the data. This will enhance code completion, error detection, and automate many workflows.

There are 5 million SQL developers worldwide. They are both critical for businesses especially large corporations, but also are highly inefficient. The market potential is huge.

These developers create data pipelines that transform operational data (e.g. transactions from finance and sales systems) into high-level dashboards critical for executive decision making (e.g. profitability by product or customer).

Their inefficiency is caused by the lack of the right tools. Functionality of SQL editor does not go far beyond basic syntax checking and column names autocompletion. Compare this with software engineers who enjoy VSCode and IntelliJ and GitHub Copilot.

EXAMPLE OF A FEATURE

Example of a feature

One of the huge issues is business logic inconsistency. In a toy example, part of a team of 1,000 business intelligence analysts in some large bank would define a large client as revenue above $4 mln, while other part as revenue above $5 mln. This creates inconsistent reporting and multiple errors. Alternatively, they could have different grouping of the regions, filter out different types deals or products, and so on.

Solution is for the IDE to analyse the query analyst writes. If there is a code snippet, that looks similar but not exact to others in the code base, the IDE would highlight this as a potential error. Then it'd find the example that looks like a reliable version (say revenue above $5 mln is used in the production pipelines or by the majority of users), and suggest this as an alternative.","Python,     SQL,     Node.js,     JavaScript    ",Data Engineering,United Kingdom,,$13.00,$16.00,https://www.upwork.com/ab/feed/jobs/rss?paging=NaN-undefined&payment_verified=1&q=(%22AI%20Engineer%22%20OR%20%22Data%20Engineer%22%20OR%20%22Cloud%20Engineer%22%20OR%20%22AWS%22%20OR%20%22Amazon%20Web%20Services%22%20OR%20%22Python%22%20OR%20%22Terraform%22%20OR%20%22DevOps%22%20OR%20%22SQL%22%20OR%20%22AWS%22%20OR%20%22Prompt%20Engineering%22)%20AND%20NOT%20(%22Google%20Cloud%22%20OR%20%22React%22%20OR%20%22Angular%22%20OR%20%22Tableau%22%20OR%20%22Ruby%22%20OR%20%22Laravel%22)&sort=recency&api_params=1&securityToken=75380e3d9358ff90936854a38a1b702b2f5e24519685701c6e412b66a48dccbca92f92dfdd61072831e978487b0af1f98ec0399c1771e068b429b47f60bb1d53&userUid=1771518215878287360&orgUid=1771518215878287361,,,,,

The project I believe has 3 parts: 

1. Chart with live rates.

2. Technical indicator

3. Database for indicator signal log files

Chart: I want a chart similar to TradingView. I found a step-by-step guide to build this. I would like both candlestick and line chart views. Google to read and understand: Replicating TradingView Chart in Python

Currency pairs: USDZAR, EURZAR, GBPZAR, CNYZAR, ZARJPY, CHFZAR

Timeframes: D1, H4, H1, M15

Indicators: The main technical indicator will be SuperTrend, with a slight modification to display directional arrows instead of buy/sell words. There are various Supertrend indicators in Github too look at. Later I might want to add more indicators.

Database: I need a database logging all trends identified by SuperTrend on different pairs and

timeframes, including historical data. The database should update automatically. Desired stats:

• Average trend length (days, hours, minutes)

• Average price movement (cents, percentage)

• SuperTrend accuracy on each timeframe (measured from the open price at trend start to

the open price at the next trend start)

I am open to fixed offers to build this.","Python,     Forex Trading,     Data Science    ",Data Analytics,South Africa,$150.00,,,https://www.upwork.com/ab/feed/jobs/rss?paging=NaN-undefined&payment_verified=1&q=(%22AI%20Engineer%22%20OR%20%22Data%20Engineer%22%20OR%20%22Cloud%20Engineer%22%20OR%20%22AWS%22%20OR%20%22Amazon%20Web%20Services%22%20OR%20%22Python%22%20OR%20%22Terraform%22%20OR%20%22DevOps%22%20OR%20%22SQL%22%20OR%20%22AWS%22%20OR%20%22Prompt%20Engineering%22)%20AND%20NOT%20(%22Google%20Cloud%22%20OR%20%22React%22%20OR%20%22Angular%22%20OR%20%22Tableau%22%20OR%20%22Ruby%22%20OR%20%22Laravel%22)&sort=recency&api_params=1&securityToken=75380e3d9358ff90936854a38a1b702b2f5e24519685701c6e412b66a48dccbca92f92dfdd61072831e978487b0af1f98ec0399c1771e068b429b47f60bb1d53&userUid=1771518215878287360&orgUid=1771518215878287361,,,,,

Vincent Fayen reached out to you this morning with an issue we have about suspicious activity.

Now our credit card is blocked in our Amazon Seller Account and we cannot advertise anymore.

Iv'e had daily contact with Amazon Support for over a week now, but still nothing is solved and there seems to be no solution as they gave me this reply to my questions about when I can expect the problem will be solved:

Hello from Amazon Advertiser Support,

We received your concern regarding account being suspended.

Your account is suspended due to suspicious activity and cannot be enabled at the moment.

Please do not re-open the case as we cannot disclose the exact reason behind the suspension.

We appreciate your understanding in this regards.

We hope that you can help us with this matter, because if the case stays like this we will be paying storage costs without making any sales at all and we don't know how long it will take to solve this case as we get no straight answer from Amazon Support. 

Please let me know if you think you can help us.

Project Management Database Development - Upwork,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Project-Management-Database-Development_%7E01bb7018d9c635797b?source=rss,6/4/2024 9:39pm,"We are looking for a skilled database developer to create a comprehensive database system for managing our parts inventory. The main goal is to streamline the ordering process and track the logistics of the parts. 

We need to database to also assist with managing small projects within the company and on a particular job site, a small project will be established and all parts required either in stock or ordered will be allocated to the project, orders will then be tracked and their progress will be displayed in the project file. When the parts arrive onsite, this will also be displayed within the project file and the location where they are stored.

The database will have to have user management abilites, e.g employees will need to sign in to create an account, there will also be different levels of user access.

I believe that the quickest way to set up an inventory, is to scan the suppliers bar code for a part, but then marry that barcode, to a barcode that we develop, this will result in the same format for all of the parts we have on file and not have to continuously cater for many different suppliers barcodes. We may want to hae our barcode located at different locations around the site to be scanned, it will be hard to maintain if we use a different format for each supplier / product. 

The suppliers will be scanned once and this will be referenced next time we scan the same product, but it will be the barcode with our format that will be displayed.

The customers barcode is still essential, as the database needs to be able store our suppliers products catalogue, this will help with ordering new and or replacement parts.

We need to be able to enter many suppliers catalogue with the suppliers barcode, all the different suppliers barcodes will be referenced to a barcode that we generate.

A full scalable asset history needs to be available, we need to be able to enter details of machinery and other assets etc. This needs to be capable of storing ongoing data entry for each machine / asset.

We need search engines, we need to be able to search a prjoject and everything associated with the project, search order numbers and everything associated with the order, search assets by names and or numbers, 

The database should be user-friendly, efficient, and highly secure. The ideal candidate should have expertise in database design, development, and optimization. 

   Responsibilities:

   - Design and develop a database to manage parts inventory

   - Design and develop a database that can manage suppliers product catalogue

   - Develop capabilites to place order to suppliers via their product catalogue that is stored in the database

   - Design and develop a database that can manage all company assets, including save all ongoing data entry for each asset.

   - Design and develop search engines within the database, this will be capable of seraching parts, assets, orders, projects etc

   - Implement an intuitive user interface for easy data entry and retrieval

Salesforce Data Cloud Architecture Consultation - Upwork,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Salesforce-Data-Cloud-Architecture-Consultation_%7E0187536282af7adb0c?source=rss,6/4/2024 9:01pm,"We are attempting to use Salesforce Data Cloud to enable payment of pending transactions to customers/independent contractors. Our main problem is we need to create records in Data Cloud, and we're concerned about the risk of overwriting with a calculated insight.

At a high level, our current strategy is outlined below:

1. We plan to have a Data Lake Object (DLO) called “Payment Transactions” (Table A).

2. We want to use a Payments Calculated (CI) (Table B) Insight to process new transactions.

3. We want this CI to write these new payment records and add a payment ID to, ideally, another DLO in Data Cloud (Table C), but we aren’t certain if that would work.

4. Once the new payment records are written in the DLO (or alternative), then it would update the Payment Transactions DLO (Table A-Updated) with the payment ID created through the process and change the transaction status to “Payment Created”

I've attached Payment_Transaction_Tables_Flows.png which helps describe the above.

I've also attached an image with Lucidchart in the title which is a diagram/flowchart of how this would look.

What we need:

1.) Consultation and validation of our strategy.

2.) Advice on how to implement, if needed.

We will handle the implementation ourselves. Since we are not familiar with Data Cloud, we just need an expert to help advise and mitigate any concerns.

The search engine helps people find software products by letting them type in a task they're trying to accomplish at work or a category of software products, and the end result are software companies who best meet the user's needs. 

The database is full of software companies, with the rows being software companies, and the columns serving as data points on these companies, like their location, product features, description, team size, etc. We are currently using a DB that is outdated, and need to do the following:

1. Replace this OLD DB with a new DB, that has the same columns as the OLD DB, but now has NEW rows (new software companies)

2. Switch over to call the GPT 4o API, instead of the 3.5 API we are currently using.

This is a very time sensitive task and can lead to a full-time position.

Mint and transfer Solana NFTs when triggerd by a webhook - Upwork,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Mint-and-transfer-Solana-NFTs-when-triggerd-webhook_%7E019bcc22b58b0e7d3b?source=rss,6/4/2024 4:22pm,"The idea is roughly to reward Solana users that paid more than amount X of a given token type to one of a few given Solana addresses with a special NFT.

See a rough description in the attached sequence diagram.

--

A user does a transaction (payment) on the Solana blockchain to a small set of specific (hard-coded) target Solana addresses.

A webhook (e.g. Helius WebHook) detects that transaction and sends (as https post) either the transaction hash (ID) or  transaction hash (ID)  and the transaction details to your program.

Your program processes this webhook request, extracts the transaction details performs some simple checks. If conditions are met, your program needs to send an NFT (non-fungible token) to the respective Solana address from the given transaction hash.

The whole process should take less than 7 seconds.

Your node.js program should run in a serverless way (e.g. AWS Lambda, GCP CloudRun or something similar)

Regarding NFT:  it's currently unclear to me whether it's better to mint them on-demand or mint them upfront and just fetch one of those when needed. 

Disclaimer: currently the artwork has not yet been done. We can test it with some very cheap or free NFTs.

FYI: I've set a fixed price. But we can discuss.

Bubble.io + Supabase + GoogleAuth + Discord Auth + Stripe

We are starting a new company: http://kogi.ai 

Kogi is an AI company which is producing text and animations which show how to repair mechanical machines.  We have expert AI Engineers on staff which are producing AI Agents which enter all the data into Supabase/Postgres.  You will not need to worry about how the instruction data is produced - another team will handle that.

Your goal is to build and maintain the Bubble.io front end which displays the content from the Supabase/Postgres database

We have built an MVP of the App in Bubble.io , this was built by a large Bubble Dev shop.

This was done quickly and is rough but functional.

We now want to hire our own team of Bubble.io Engineers to help us clean up the app and get it ready for alpha launch within the next 2-4 weeks.

The main functionality of the App is in place, but we need to add some features in order to be able to launch.

We have 3 UX designers on our team which can help with any design needs.

You must have experience with connecting Bubble to Postgres/Supabase database.

We also have integrations with:

Google Auth

Discord Auth

Stripe

Google Analytics

Here is a video walkthrough of what the App looks like right now:

This is not a project for someone just learning Bubble.io - the API integrations are complex and will be challenging unless you have done this before.

I am happy to answer any questions you may have about this project.

thank you for taking the time to consider working with us.

help with an AWS services system to receive data via MQTT and then make it available for download - Upwork,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/help-with-AWS-services-system-receive-data-via-MQTT-and-then-make-available-for-download_%7E01fbe6fab6861b7636?source=rss,6/4/2024 2:00pm,"We have different devices that can publish data via MQTT. We need help setting up AWS system to receive the data. The data should be stored by the device serial number. The data should be made available to the customer based on the serial number. (for example: customer 1 can only see data from device 1234 and 2345 while customer 2 can only see data from device 9876 and 985 and 9043). So there should be login's per customer to get this data. While there should be a super login (ours) to see/manage all data. We would then like to be able to 1) either download data based on date and time published (from date and time 1 to date and time 2) and store this data in a database on the local PC, or an alternative - we have a python script that we run on the local computer now, that currently collects this data over an ethernet connection, to convert it into a pdf report for quality control. It would be great if this could be converted so customers can log in and generate reports online for the data published over MQTT to AWS and then download the PDF.

So essentially we are looking for someone to help us set up a system to receive data via MQTT and potentially create a system that will create a PDF report from this data using a python script we already have.","AWS Lambda,     AWS Application,     Python,     Amazon Web Services    ",Full Stack Development,Canada,,$15.00,$25.00,https://www.upwork.com/ab/feed/jobs/rss?paging=NaN-undefined&payment_verified=1&q=(%22LLMOps%22%20OR%20%22Postgres%22%20OR%20%22AWS%22%20OR%20%22LlamaIndex%22%20OR%20%22Langfuse%22%20OR%20%22Mage%22%20OR%20%22LangChain%22%20OR%20%22Boto3%22%20OR%20%22Lambda%22%20OR%20%22Claude%22)%20AND%20NOT%20(%22Google%20Cloud%22%20OR%20%22React%22%20OR%20%22Angular%22%20OR%20%22Tableau%22%20OR%20%22Ruby%22%20OR%20%22Laravel%22)&sort=recency&api_params=1&securityToken=75380e3d9358ff90936854a38a1b702b2f5e24519685701c6e412b66a48dccbca92f92dfdd61072831e978487b0af1f98ec0399c1771e068b429b47f60bb1d53&userUid=1771518215878287360&orgUid=1771518215878287361,,,,,

1. Write/create api endpoints which will listen to external service

2. Create a terraform script to spin up/down ec2 instances to execute the services 

3. External script will send a request to api endpoints above with certain paramters which will trigger the terrafrom script to spin up new instances 

4. the newly created instance will be mounted with the python scraping script to be executed.

5. The python script needs to be modified to connect and udpate the paramters and results in an RDS database 

6. the python script needs to be modified to push the scrapped data to s3 bucket and apply user sharing polices 

7. the python script will return the final s3 bucket url via email or push notification when everything is done

The platform will require integrating various APIs, building a user-friendly interface web application.

It will require expertise in the following areas:

backend development, frontend development, DevOps, and UI/UX design. Candidates can apply for specific roles they are skilled in or for multiple roles if they have the necessary expertise.

Detailed Description: 

Project Overview:

Today, there is a plethora of powerful AI software, such as Stable Diffusion, which have substantial market demand and a large pool of skilled users. These products have the potential to attract a vast number of customers. However, two significant issues must be addressed to meet this demand effectively:

i) Complex Installation and Setup:

Most AI products require intricate installation and setup processes, typically involving terminal commands and dependency management. This presents a major hurdle for many AI artists and users who lack a coding background, making it difficult for them to acquire the necessary technical expertise. The frequent updates and new products further complicate this issue, each requiring different installation and setup procedures.

ii) High System Requirements:

Many AI and ML products demand high-performance systems with advanced graphics and video cards, which are not typically available to average laptop or PC users. Therefore, scalable, cloud-based GPU-intensive systems are essential.

These challenges present an opportunity to develop a platform that addresses both issues.

Project Vision:

We aim to create a platform that enables the use of these AI products on any standard laptop or PC with ease. Our platform will feature:

i) Cloud-Based GPU-Intensive Scalable Remote Systems for rental:

Initially, we will leverage existing instances from platforms like Vast.ai, Vultr.com, lambdalabs.com etc., using their APIs. Once we have a substantial customer base and a proven business model, we will consider deploying our own machines.

ii) User-Friendly GUI Interface:

The platform will offer a GUI-based interface for the installation, execution, and automation of AI applications and models on our remote instances. This interface will allow users to install, run, and control applications with minimal effort, similar to how Pinokio.computer operates. Pinokio.computer is open-source and can be adapted for use with our rented instances.

Technical Scope:

The primary technical challenge lies in developing a Pinokio-like GUI system for instances rented from Vast.ai, Vultr.com, lambdalabs.com etc.,. Given that Pinokio.computer is open-source and we have access to Jarvislabs.ai's open-source code base, this task should not be overly complex or time-consuming. Our platform aims to be a more advanced version of Jarvislabs.com.

Proposal Requirements:

We invite you to explore the mentioned platforms (Pinokio.computer, Jarvislabs.ai, and other similar platforms like Replicate.com) and submit a comprehensive proposal. Your proposal should include:

A detailed plan

Software architecture

Team composition

Budget

Timeline

Your proposal will help us shortlist candidates for interviews.

Extensive experience with Selenium as well as with websites protected by Cloudflare is required.

I have semi working code but its very much ad-hoc and not structured into PageObjects so it can serve as a starting point. Please note that work needs to be done in C# not Python.

Regular c# HttpClient automation/scraping experience is also important.

Kindly respect location preferences, proposals outside these areas will not be accepted.
